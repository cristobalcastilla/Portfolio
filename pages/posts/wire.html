Wire is a modern communications network. A startup backed by Janus Friis, co-founder of Skype.

As the sole UI Motion Designer in a team of visual and interaction designers I’m responsible to lead the creation of Wire's motion guideline. A reference document that synthesises the reasoning behind the transitions and behaviour of Wire user interface and provides a consistent language for the application along different platforms and devices.

The guideline contains a set of prototypes covering the most important interactions of the application. It’s conceived as a living document that will grow and update as the product continues to develop new features and explore new interactions.
