<p>Wire is a simple tool to communicate with text, voice, pictures and media — all beautifully woven together for modern devices. A startup backed by Janus Friis, co-founder of Skype.</p>

<p>As Head of UI Motion Design I’m responsible to lead the creation of Wire's motion guideline. A reference document that synthesises the reasoning behind the transitions and behaviour of Wire user interface and provides a consistent language for the application along the different platforms and devices.</p>

<p>The guideline contains a numerous set of prototypes covering the most important interactions of the product. It’s conceived as a living document that will grow and update as the product continues to develop new features and explore new interactions.</p>

<p>Harmattan was a Meego based OS developed by Nokia. It was going to be first implemented in Nokia’s N9 device, which aimed to be the company’s entry into the competitive high-end smartphone market.</p>

<p>I was part of a small team of interaction and visual designers. My role as a UI Motion Designer consisted of translating graphic proposals made by the visual design team into functioning prototypes to help breathe life into the interface components and improve the overall user’s experience.</p>

<p>Our final goal was to define the motion guidelines that serve as reference when developing new components for the operating system, native and third party applications. To do this we had to assure homogeneity and coherence throughout the whole operating system.</p>

<p>A service for the Spanish bank EVO to understand and manage your personal finances. It was done in collaboration with a team of business strategists from Loop. As the sole designer I was in charge of both the interaction and visual design.</p>

<p>Special attention was paid to typography and visual hierarchy with the purpose of displaying complex information in a expressive and easy to understand way.</p>

<p>The goal was to create a prototype to share the values of the service within EVO's internal departments and evaluate the experience before commiting to its development. The final deliverable was an image-linked based prototype.</p>

<p>The objective of this project was to explore several concepts concerning the role icons would have on future devices. The context for the research and experimentation was not constrained to any type of device or technology in specific. It’s goal was to create a range of concepts that would generate new questions and inspire further investigation.</p>

<p>The project was done by a small team of 3 visual and interaction designers including myself. I was part of the brainstorming sessions and also responsible for creating visuals and prototypes to explored our ideas.</p>
